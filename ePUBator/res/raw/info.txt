Minimal offline PDF to ePUB converter for Android

ePUBator extract text from a PDF file and put it in a well formed (epubcheck compliant) ePUB file.

PDF extraction based on iText library <http://itextpdf.com/> released under the AGPL license. 

- ePUBator doesn't need internet connection.
- ePUBator doesn't send your docs somewhere on the net.
- ePUBator doesn't have ads.
- ePUBator extract text (no text in pictures or in raster PDF).
- ePUBator try to extract images (only png, jpg and gif) but puts them at the page's end.
- ePUBator try to extract the table of contents if present (or creates a dummy TOC).
- ePUBator doesn't extract the font size and style.
- ePUBator put the ePUB file in the same folder of PDF file.
- ePUBator uses the PDF filename to generate ePUB filename and the title in the frontpage.
- ePUBator works fine with single column PDF (can work bad with multi column or tables).
- ePUBator can fail extraction (5 of 358 books with v0.8.1 on my Atrix).
- ePUBator IS MADE FOR BOOKS, NOT FOR EVERY TYPE OF PDF (DON'T ASK IT TOO MUCH).

WARNING!!!
In the event of crash, unexpected stoppages or insufficient memory try setting Page per file to 1 and/or disable the extraction of images and try again (sometimes helps).

I converted a lot of books (italians and some english) with ePUBator, but with someone the conversion can fail (raster PDF, columns, out of order chars).

I never try with arabic or asian characters, right to left or vertical writing and I don't know if (and how) the iText library can manage those pdf. I'm sorry.
