Minimal offline PDF to ePUB converter for Android

ePUBator extract text from a PDF file and put it in a well formed (epubcheck compliant) ePUB file.

PDF extraction based on iText library <http://itextpdf.com/> released under the AGPL license. 

- ePUBator doesn't need internet connection.
- ePUBator doesn't send your docs somewhere on the net.
- ePUBator doesn't have ads.
- ePUBator extract text (no text in pictures).
- ePUBator try to extract images (only png, jpg and gif) but puts them at the page's end.
- ePUBator doesn't extract the table of contents but creates a dummy index.
- ePUBator works fine with single column PDF (can work bad with multi column or tables).
- ePUBator can fail extraction (17 of 100 books tested: it looks like a iText problem). 

WARNING!!!
In the event of crash, unexpected stoppages or insufficient memory try setting Page per file to 1 and/or disable the extraction of images and try again (sometimes helps).
