Minimal offline PDF to ePUB converter for Android

ePUBator extract text from a PDF file and put it in a well formed (epubcheck compliant) ePUB file.

PDF extraction based on iText library <http://itextpdf.com/>. 

- ePUBator doesn't need internet connection.
- ePUBator doesn't have ads.
- ePUBator extract text (no text in pictures).
- ePUBator doesn't show images in preview (for now).
- ePUBator extract images (experimental, only png, jpg and gif).
- ePUBator works fine with single column PDF (can work bad with multi column or tables).
- ePUBator can fail extraction (12 of 60 books tested: it looks like a iText problem).
