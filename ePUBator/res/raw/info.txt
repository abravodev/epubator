Minimal offline PDF to ePUB converter for Android

ePUBator extract text from a PDF file and put it in a well formed (epubcheck compliant) ePUB file.
PDF extraction based on iText library <http://itextpdf.com/>. 

- ePUBator doesn't need internet connection.
- ePUBator doesn't have ads.
- ePUBator extract only text (no pictures, no text in pictures).
- ePUBator works fine with single column PDF (can work bad with multi column or tables).
- ePUBator can fail extraction (12 of 60 books tested: I'm still working on it but it looks like a iText problem). 
- ePUBator can crash (out of memory crash resolved, I hope).
