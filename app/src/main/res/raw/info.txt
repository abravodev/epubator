Minimal offline PDF to ePUB converter for Android - ©2011 Ezio Querini

ePUBator extract text from a PDF file and put it in a well formed (epubcheck compliant) ePUB file.

PDF extraction based on iText library <http://itextpdf.com/> released under the AGPL license. 

- ePUBator IS THINKED FOR BOOKS (NOT FOR EVERY TYPE OF PDF), BUT IF YOU NEED A BETTER RESULT TRY SOMETHING ELSE LIKE CALIBRE.
- ePUBator doesn't need internet connection (doesn't send your docs somewhere on the net, doesn't have ads).
- ePUBator extracts text (no text from pictures or from raster PDF).
- ePUBator tries to extract images (only png, jpg and gif) but puts them at the page's end.
- ePUBator tries to extract the table of contents if present (or creates a dummy TOC).
- ePUBator doesn't extract the font size and style.
- ePUBator saves the ePUB file in the same folder of PDF file or in Download folder if PDF folder is not writable or if it is set in Settings.
- ePUBator works fine only with single column PDF (worse with multi column or tables).
- ePUBator can fail extraction (5 of 358 books with v0.8.1 on my Atrix).

WARNING!!!
In the event of crash, unexpected stoppages or insufficient memory try setting Page per file to 1 and/or disable the extraction of images and try again (sometimes helps).

I converted a lot of books (italians and some english) with ePUBator, but with someone the conversion can fail (raster PDF, columns, out of order chars).

I never try with arabic or asian characters, right to left or vertical writing and I don't know if (and how) the iText library can manage those pdf. I'm sorry.

On some books we can find wrong chars (e.g. Ψψ instead of ιω), it seems a iText's problem (another PDF library extract the same text correctly). I'm looking for a better one, free and Android compatible.
